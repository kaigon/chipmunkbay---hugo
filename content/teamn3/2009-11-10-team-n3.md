The Team N3 &#8216;Other Stuff&#8217; link to the lower right is still not working, but the comics now exist within the Chipmunk Bay main archives. I&#8217;ve not yet decided whether to leave them in the main archives or keep em separated. I think it works having them in there atm, but I might change my mind at any moment. I&#8217;m like that.

Made some minor backend tweaks that likely nobody will notice, and I&#8217;ve got the e-mail link working now (least in the 4 browsers I&#8217;ve tested it on). I have it on my list to add a contact form instead of a &#8216;mailto&#8217; link, since I don&#8217;t know anyone who still uses Outlook as their main e-mail client. Most everyone seems to have switched to a browser based e-mail like Gmail or Hotmail, so a link that automatically opens Outlook on click doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense anymore. Still, this is pretty low on my priority list.

That&#8217;s it for now. More to come.
