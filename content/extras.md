## Other comics
not really maintained anymore. But see them preserved here for all eternity!

### Guest Comics

Here are some comics that I've made for other sites that I can no longer find on their sites.

### Team N3

These comics feature the gang and their adventures from the now defunct Neener Neener website. Some of the characters will be familiar to Chipmunk Bay fans.

### Ninja Monkey

I made a comic for Ninja Monkey in the 'traditional' comic book format. It's very terrible. You should read it!

### Mouse House

Before Chipmunk Bay, there was Mouse House. Pretty much the same characters, and similar jokes. And the art is super bad. Enjoy!

## Non-comic projects

### Tales of Dereth

My first brush with 'internet notoriety' came from "Tales of Dereth", my humor-based blog documenting my adventures in the game of Asheron's Call.

Wow these are dumb. Holy shit. But still, here you go.

### Neener Neener

I wrote some humor-based articles for NeenerNeener.net back in the day. I don't have them all. But here's what I gots!

## Podcast

### Before I was a staff member at NeenerNeener, they interviewed me for a podcast. This is hard to listen to cause I sound like a turd.

## Unfunny stuff

### BrainMark

I maintain a developer's blog of sorts. Mostly I collect snippets of code I've written, short reminder tutorials for how I did stuff, and templates I've made. Because I'm too dumb to remember any of it otherwise.

### Art o mine

My deviantArt page. Like most of the other stuff on this page: preserved, but not really maintained.
