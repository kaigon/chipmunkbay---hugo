What I didn&#8217;t show you is the part where he made Ninja Monkey cart him to a phone booth so he could change shirts and clip on the cape. He couldn&#8217;t close the door though, what with the arms sticking out like that, so he leaned against the phone booth and cried for 45 minutes.

Up, up, and away!!
