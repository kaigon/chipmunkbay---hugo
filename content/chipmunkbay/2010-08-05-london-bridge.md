Ok, so I acknowledge that this is easily the dumbest comic I&#8217;ve ever done, but I can&#8217;t stop laughing at it. I&#8217;m probably just really tired.

This is really just &#8216;filler&#8217;, since I didn&#8217;t have time to draw an actual comic tonight. This only took me like 30 minutes. No, it&#8217;s true! I know it LOOKS like I labored on it for hours and hours, but I honestly didn&#8217;t!

It&#8217;s just a gift.
