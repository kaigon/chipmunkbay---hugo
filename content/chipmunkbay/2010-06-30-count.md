This is one of those comics that had a totally different punchline while I was drawing it, but once it was on my computer I thought of something better.

That happens a lot. 

In fact, I&#8217;d say about half of my comics don&#8217;t even have a proper punchline until after I&#8217;ve picked the idea, drawn it, scanned it, and have started typing the words. The entire time I&#8217;m drawing / scanning / etc though, I&#8217;m trying to figure out how the idea is going to be funny.

&#8230;sometimes I figure it out.
