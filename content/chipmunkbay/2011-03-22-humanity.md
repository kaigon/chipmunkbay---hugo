Wait, Diablo 1 or 2? Choose carefully! The sake of humanity hangs in the balance! 

I think there would be fewer super heroes if video games were more prevalent in the DC / Marvel universes. &#8220;Go out and prowl the streets looking for bad guys? No thanks, I have a raid in 5. Gonna hit level cap tonight! I&#8217;ll look for bad guys on my way to the gas station for my nightly Dew run.&#8221;

Also, I plan to re-use the crap out of that opening shot of the Beta Station building after all the time I spend on it. Perspective is hard. =P
