I wonder how much sense these comics make if you haven&#8217;t played this game before (or even recently), since a lot of the gags are based purely on the context of the in-game quest dialogue (as is the case with this one).

Hopefully they still make sense, cause I&#8217;ve got like 6 more to do yet. =P
