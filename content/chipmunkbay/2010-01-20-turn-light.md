I wrote this story arc over three years ago when I began the sprinkles gags. Each part was scripted out. Karen tricks Jacob into eating sprinkles, and the cat explodes as a result. 

Last month, after I started drawing the strips again, picking up the story where it had left off, my parents&#8217; cat died in an similar fashion (probably unrelated to sprinkles though). I&#8217;m not clear on the details, but it was apparently a tumor or something. That exploded.

So, should my family be reading this&#8230; I was not &#8216;inspired&#8217; by Ozzie&#8217;s passing. The timing is just a really really bad coincidence.
