I wrote this story arc over three years ago when I began the sprinkles gags. 

It's based on a true story. My dad bought some groceries as a kid. His parents were in financial strain, but nonetheless he snuck in a purchase of a sprinkle-covered donut for himself. Then on the way a woman was killed and dragged by a bus right in front of his eyes. Kid-logic dictates that it was his fault for being selfish and treating himself to some sprinkles.

Fast-forward to now. I have a character who believes that when he eats sprinkles he can kill people. He eats sprinkles, and a cat explodes.

Last month my parents&#8217; cat essentially exploded in their bathtub. Tumor or something. But it actually exploded.

I know it happened before I drew these strips (though I didn't find out until a couple days ago), but maybe there's something to this whole 'sprinkles are bad luck' thing after all.

(I'm never going to stop eating sprinkles)
