It&#8217;s about time we had some new artwork on the front page, doncha think?

I think this will be my last Diablo comic for a while. I still had a couple more ideas, but I&#8217;m not 100% convinced that they&#8217;re funny to anyone who doesn&#8217;t love Diablo like I did. Time to go back to regular silliness.

By the way, I had to uninstall 5 different games to do this comic. I kept getting &#8216;disks are full&#8217; errors with only 6 gigs of free space on my computer whenever I tried to crop / copy-paste / save. This comic is over a gig in size. That&#8217;s twice the size of any of my other comics. It took 20 minutes to save it (no exaggeration). Hopefully that impresses someone other than me. Whoever said that they refuse to work in files that are less than 900 resolution (I read a &#8216;how to guide once that claimed 900 rez as the minimum) is an idiot. Or they have a computer that&#8217;s easily 10 times better than mine.

So another 2 months went by without an update. I&#8217;ve had a few inquiries about that, and while I&#8217;m sure I could give lots of reasons why I have little time that you would all totally buy (I&#8217;m an excellent liar via the keyboard), I&#8217;ll instead fess up and admit that the comic has not been a passion of mine lately. 

Most recently I&#8217;ve had a strong desire to update my portfolio. Probably because I&#8217;ve been hiring new designers at work recently, and looking over all the portfolios has been both inspirational and depressing. Depressing largely because I&#8217;m fairly certain I wouldn&#8217;t hire myself based on my current portfolio.

So when I get free time, rather than wanting to work on a comic, I find I&#8217;d much prefer to work on graphic design related projects. In fact, right now I&#8217;m kicking myself for spending so much time on this comic when I had hoped to wrap up a portfolio piece this weekend that will now have to wait.

I&#8217;m not planning to leave my job anytime soon, so this desire is purely from a personal desire standpoint. Still, it&#8217;s hard to ignore. And it makes working on the comic feel more like a job than a fun hobby, which results in 2 months without a comic. 

So forewarning. I haven&#8217;t stopped updating. Chipmunk Bay is still an ongoing project that I&#8217;ve not abandoned. But updates are going to happen on a &#8216;that sounds like fun today&#8217; basis. ðŸ™‚
