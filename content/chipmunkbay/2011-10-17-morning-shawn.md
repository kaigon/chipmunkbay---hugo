I scrapped my first joke of Kaigon walking past the urn and seeing it, and then freaking out because he&#8217;s never seen it, and was thus terrified of Shawn&#8217;s head on the mantle. But I didn&#8217;t think anyone would understand why he was freaking out.

Possibly because I killed Shawn a year ago and have only done maybe 12 comics since.
  
But we&#8217;ll never know for sure if that&#8217;s why you didn&#8217;t laugh at the comic you never read that I never drew.
