This comic is 3 weeks in the making. I hope it&#8217;s obvious I put a lot of time / effort into this one.
  
I also did it in Illustrator instead of Photoshop, which probably means nothing to most of you, but to ME, it was a big change. 

I&#8217;m not sure the benefits I gained by going that route are worth the tradeoff of having to spend the extra time on it. It&#8217;s possible that after doing 30 comics in Illustrator, I&#8217;ll find ways to speed that up, but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m willing to wait. 

Also, my wife and I talk like this all the time, and have actually done so in front of other people. It&#8217;s always in fun &#8216;one-upmanship&#8217; spirit, but I&#8217;m pretty sure we&#8217;ve made other people very uncomfortable.
