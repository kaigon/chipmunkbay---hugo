Also, was anyone else ever baffled by the fact that Jeryhn let you run around solving like 8 other quests in his town before he bothered to mention &#8220;Oh, hey, mister heroes, my palace is overrun by demons. Think maybe you could help with that? Thanks.&#8221;

He&#8217;s locked out of his palace because DEMONS have kicked him out, and yet he just sits around waiting for us heroes to prove ourselves worthy of trying to help him clear out his palace.

Jeryhn&#8217;s a moron is what I&#8217;m saying.
