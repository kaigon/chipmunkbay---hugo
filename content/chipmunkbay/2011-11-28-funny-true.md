So I&#8217;ve felt pretty awful all weekend. And I got into a temporary, weekend-only Star Wars beta. Saturday wasn&#8217;t too bad, but Sunday was almost painful to look at the monitor. The only thing that was worse was that putting my head on the pillow actually hurt more.

Don&#8217;t worry though. Through all the pain; all the vomiting, dizziness, vertigo, and prayers for death&#8230; I still managed to play Star Wars.
