This is probably not the sort of response a frightened little kid should get from his parents. But really, it&#8217;s mostly his fault. Couldn&#8217;t he have led up to it a bit? You don&#8217;t just jump right out and say &#8220;Hey, my butthole feels great when I poke at it! What&#8217;s for dinner?&#8221; That sort of thing is just begging to send your parents into shock.

Subtlety.
