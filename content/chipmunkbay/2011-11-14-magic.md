I really do love those things. I think I prefer the ones that are random dots and lines though, rather than the patterned images. Like a bunch of really messed up palm trees? They always look hideous. I somehow prefer the random colored static dots.

After all the time I spent on that stupid bookstore background, I think the next 50 comics need to be in a bookstore.
