I had to go with a lot smaller text in today&#8217;s comic in order to make room for all the text / artwork. Hopefully you didn&#8217;t notice until reading this. And now, if you&#8217;re anything like me, you won&#8217;t be able to UN-notice it. And it will drive you crazy.

Anyway, thought you all might enjoy an image taken from my scratch notepad while trying to work through the storyline where Shawn tries to dispose of Crystal&#8217;s body.

<img src="http://www.chipmunkbay.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/head.gif" alt="It&#039;s a toilet." title="It&#039;s a toilet." width="400" height="484" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1196" />

And then Kaigon walks in, and Shawn looks abashed and says &#8220;Oh, hey, Kaigon. Didn&#8217;t expect you back so soon. So&#8230; how was church?&#8221;

And then he holds up the charred skull towards Kaigon and and says &#8220;Don&#8217;t be rude. Say hi to Crystal!&#8221;

But then I remembered that Kaigon doesn&#8217;t go to church, so I had to do something else.
