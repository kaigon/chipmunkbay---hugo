I showed this one to my wife and she was insistent that a woman would not just continue to stand there like that as a man or woman so blatantly ogled her chest. She was somehow convinced that Angela was not just standing nonchalantly, but was in fact propping her breasts up to put them further on display.

I told her that Angela is kinda slutty, so normal woman rules don&#8217;t apply. Plus it&#8217;s a comic, so some suspension of belief might be required.

She continued to argue the point until I escorted her out of the room and shut the door so I could finish coloring the comic. Now she won&#8217;t let me touch her breasts.

I suffer for my craft.
