Man, I lost soooo much detail in those treants. Oh well.

I would love to do this. Just fly up 1,000 feet, and pop my Force of Nature, and rain treants all over Orgrimmar. Maybe see if I could fly down faster than they could fall so I could flip them off again before they hit the ground.

This might be my favorite alt-comic ever, btw. I made it my new [Facebook cover][1].
  
Some day I&#8217;ll have to do a real one&#8230; but for now, this is pretty awesome.
