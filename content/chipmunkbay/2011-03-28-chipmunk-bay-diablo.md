You know, I really like the alt-graphics, but some of these are pretty much a comic in and of themselves. Granted, I don&#8217;t think the jokes are strong enough to warrant their own comic, but still.

That&#8217;s totally gonna be my excuse for cutting my update schedule back. =P 

Speaking of the alt-comics&#8230; I have no idea how I&#8217;ll include those in any book I&#8217;d want to eventually make. That seems like the sort of thing I should probably plan for.

Oh, look! Warcraft! \*logs in and forgets everything\*
