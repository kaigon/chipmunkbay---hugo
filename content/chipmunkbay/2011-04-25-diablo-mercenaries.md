I know the world is about to end and all, but seriously. These mercs do not get paid enough to venture into hell and act as a meat shield for the hero. Even if they can be resurrected. That whole dying thing has to hurt at least a little bit. If not the dying part itself, then at least the fireball to the face that resulted in said dying.

And archer mercenaries **are** shit.
