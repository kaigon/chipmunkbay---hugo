This is one of those comics that changed entirely from what I&#8217;d sat down originally to draw. It was along the same vein / topic; I just took it in a completely different direction / punchline. Now I need to decide if I want to do the original joke later, or if I skip it and move on. 

Stay tuned to see what I do!
  
Assuming I tell you. If I don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll never know.

Don&#8217;t let that drive you insane.
