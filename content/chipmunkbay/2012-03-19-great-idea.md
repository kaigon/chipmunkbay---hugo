So my site got hit with a malware infection recently, and I had to delete and reupload everything. Many thanks to Juan for helping me realize there was a problem and pointing out where it was.

The end result is that I&#8217;m malware free again, but the website&#8217;s content is maybe half here at the moment. It&#8217;s going to take a couple weeks of slowly putting my archives back together, and some of the sections, like the &#8216;New Reader&#8217;, or half the &#8216;Extras&#8217; links are probably going to stay busted even longer. I&#8217;ve been toying with a new design that I was going to just slap on here, but since I need to start rebuilding from the ground up anyway, I&#8217;ll probably just roll that into a new site build instead.

I&#8217;m in no particular hurry to get that done, so comics should still keep coming. I&#8217;ll get the broken stuff fixed as I have time.

Regarding today&#8217;s comic; it&#8217;s a tribute to the old stickmen comics I used to draw as a kid. I usually had 3 pens / markers&#8230; a black pen that I&#8217;d draw the background with, and then a red and blue pen for the various colored stickmen who&#8217;d then kill each other by throwing knives, shooting bazookas, driving tanks, etc.

I had notebooks filled with them, and they morphed from single sheet scenes to notebook-spanning epic storylines, and were the direct link between simply drawing to drawing comics.

I really wish I&#8217;d have kept some.Â  :\
