Consider this a tribute to the old stickmen comics I used to draw as a kid. I usually had 3 pens / markers&#8230; a black pen that I&#8217;d draw the background with, and then a red and blue pen for the various colored stickmen who&#8217;d then kill each other by throwing knives, shooting bazookas, driving tanks, etc.

I had notebooks filled with them, and they morphed from single sheet scenes to notebook-spanning epic storylines, and were the direct link between simply drawing to drawing comics.

I really wish I&#8217;d have kept some.Â  :\
