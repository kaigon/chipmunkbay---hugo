Whoops. Actually finished this on Sunday but forgot to upload.

I&#8217;ve been doing the last few comics on my wacom tablet. It&#8217;s less frustrating in that I can fix mistakes I&#8217;ve made inking easier and on the spot, but it can be frequently difficult to get the look I want when drawing on the tablet and looking at the screen instead of my pencil. I&#8217;ve been using a tablet for years, but mostly for touchup or for more elaborate photoshop paintings. Doing a comic, which has very strict, tight lines, has always been difficult for me.

I really need to find a way to get me one of those cintiq tablets.
