I&#8217;m thinking I can safely claim that Chipmunk Bay has more nuclear explosions than any other webcomic on the internet.

I originally planned to have Wolf sitting opposite him, with Starcraft 2 loaded on his screen laughing, having obviously been the one responsible for the nuclear launch, and have that as my fifth panel. Or possibly as the alt comic.

Ultimately though, I opted to go to bed instead.
  
You&#8217;re welcome.
