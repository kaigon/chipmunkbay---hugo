Man I hope this joke makes sense.
  
I was originally going to have it be fairly text heavy, but I think the lack of text makes it funnier. It probably makes it harder for anyone who wouldn&#8217;t immediately recognize Alfred / the bat cave though. Especially since I didn&#8217;t have time to clean up my artwork.

Speaking of, it&#8217;s 3:30am. G&#8217;night.
