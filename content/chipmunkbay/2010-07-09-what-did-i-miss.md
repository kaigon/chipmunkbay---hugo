Did you see that? He was in and out of there so fast, he&#8217;d barely have had time to zip his fly back up, let alone buckle his belt. Do you think he washed his hands? I bet he didn&#8217;t. He totally didn&#8217;t. Not in THAT amount of time. And if he did, he probably just turned on the sink and got his hands wet, but didn&#8217;t use soap, which is really a waste of time. So really all he did was touch the sink handles with piss covered hands, TWICE, and then wiped that piss all over the towel dispenser. You know he didn&#8217;t have time for a blow dryer, so it had to be towels. And he looks like a guy who grabs 7 or 8 towels instead of the 2 he really needs, so he was probably pumping away at the dispenser over and over, just grinding his pee covered hands all over that handle. Now everyone else who touches that handle now has pee on their hands. Even though they already washed! By &#8216;pretending&#8217; to wash his hands, he did more damage than if he&#8217;d just have walked out of the bathroom soaked in pee! Who pees all over their hands, anyway? God, japanese are so sick. 

I bet he didn&#8217;t flush, either. Man I&#8217;m tired.
