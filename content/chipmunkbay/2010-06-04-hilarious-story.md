I was originally going to just have Shawn beating off into a kleenex for 3 panels, but that seemed a little too crude, even for me. 

Besides, this version lets me have the single greatest fourth panel in my archives. Take any comic I&#8217;ve ever done, and replace the final panel with this one, and it&#8217;ll be funnier.

That&#8217;s actually kind of depressing.
