I agree with Ninja Monkey. This looked just fine as a line drawing. The more I fleshed it out as a painting, the creepier it got. It&#8217;s almost like my cartoon characters aren&#8217;t drawn with realistic proportions!

So it&#8217;s been like 3 months since my last update. I would have posted a blog post, but I kind of removed the ability to post blog updates without a comic, so that was kind of stupid of me.

I don&#8217;t really have a reason for the huge hiatus. Needing to block out 6+ hours per comic certainly doesn&#8217;t help though. I&#8217;m going to try to work on speeding up the strip process.
