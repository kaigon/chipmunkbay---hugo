I&#8217;m pretty sure that would get him held in contempt. If he wasn&#8217;t already in jail, that is.

The joke worked best as a single shot, in my opinion. I always wonder if people think that&#8217;s a cheap way for me to get out of doing a &#8216;real&#8217; strip. Frankly, they&#8217;re often harder to pull off than a strip with multiple panels. But it probably doesn&#8217;t look that way. 

Now, my coloring job, on the other hand&#8230; THAT was totally due to my poor time management.
