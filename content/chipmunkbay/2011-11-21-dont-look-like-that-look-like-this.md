This is totally something I would do.

&#8220;What, you can&#8217;t see it? You&#8217;re using your eyes wrong. Here, use your eyes like this, it&#8217;s easy. Do it. Come on, do it. Use your eyes. No, your eyes. See with your eyes. Yes, you&#8217;re looking, but are you SEEING? You need to see. Use your eyes and see. Don&#8217;t look. Still nothing? You probably just need glasses. You have contacts? Maybe you need **more** contacts. Or even better, less-stupid eyes. You probably have the stupidest eyes I&#8217;ve ever seen. Not looked; **seen**.&#8221;

I can&#8217;t wait to have kids.
