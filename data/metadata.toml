	name = "Chipmunk Bay"
	description = "In the tiny lake-side town of Chipmunk Bay we follow the humorous adventures of five close friends as they react to whatever situation life throws at them. Except then one of them dies in an ironically divine meteor incident, so now it’s just four close friends reacting to whatever adventures life throws at them. Well, ok, now the police have found and returned a long lost and forgotten son to them, so it’s actually now four friends and a kid having adventures. Also there’s a talking monkey. Adventure!"
